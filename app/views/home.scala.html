            <h2>Chess Rules</h2>
            <p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid. Here are some basic rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player has 16 pieces, including one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.</li>
                <li>The objective is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and cannot escape capture (mate).</li>
                <li>Pieces have specific movement rules: for example, pawns move forward one square but capture diagonally, rooks move horizontally or vertically, knights have an L-shaped move, etc.</li>
                <li>The game ends in a draw under various conditions, including a stalemate or insufficient material for checkmate.</li>
            </ul>
